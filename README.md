Hi. I am Joy. This is a project of handwritten digit recignition. In this project I used 3 type of classifiers. SVM provides me best result among these 3 models. In the last section, I compare the performance of these 3 models. I uploaded a interactive python file. You can open it in colab or other notebook. I also uploaded a python file. You also can use this. Best of luck. Please pray for me. For further queries, Please let me know.
